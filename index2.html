		<h1>Everton Football Club</h1>

		<div>
			<p>
				Everton Football Club is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England">English professional
					association football club</a> based in Liverpool that competes
				in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club was a founder member of the Football
				League in 1888 and has competed in the top division for a record 118 seasons, having missed only four
				top-flight seasons (1930–31, 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1953–54).<br> Everton is the second-longest continuous
				serving
				club in English top flight football and ranks third in the all-time points rankings. The club has won nine
				league titles, five FA Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and nine Charity Shields.

				<span>Formed in 1878, Everton won their first League Championship</span> during the 1890–91 season. After
				winning four
				more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-World War II lull until a revival in
				the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League
				championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was
				the 1995 FA Cup.

				The club's supporters are colloquially known as "Evertonians" or "Blues". Everton's main rivals are
				Liverpool, whose home stadium at Anfield is just under one mile away from Everton's home at Goodison Park;
				the two clubs contest the Merseyside derby. Everton have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, having
				moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement over its rent. The club's home colours
				are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				<span>Everton</span> was founded as St. Domingo's FC in 1878 so that members of the congregation of St
				Domingo Methodist
				New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton could play sport year round – cricket was played in
				summer. The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club. The club was renamed Everton in
				November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.

				The club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888–89 and won its first League Championship title
				in the 1890–91 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again
				in 1914–15. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were
				reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.

		<h2>Crest</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				At the end of the 1937–38 season,<span>Everton</span> secretary Theo Kelly, who later became the club's
				first manager,
				wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of
				designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a
				reproduction of Everton Lock-Up, which stands in the heart of the Everton district. The Lock-Up has been
				inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a
				bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on Everton Brow. The
				Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the College of Arms in
				London, Kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by
				the club motto, "Nil Satis Nisi Optimum", meaning "Nothing but the best is good enough". The ties were first
				worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the 1938–39 season.

				The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on its shirts. An interwoven "EFC" design was
				adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold "EFC"
				lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team's shirts in 1978 and has
				remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.

				In May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and
				broadcast media, particularly on a small scale. Critics[who?] suggested that it was external pressure from
				sports manufacturer Nike, Inc. that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the
				radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce.[citation needed] The
				redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative
				response to the crest.<br> A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an
				apology
				and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014–15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation.
				Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3
				October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the
				final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part and began being used in
				July 2014.

		<h3>Stadium</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Everton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park. The first official match took place in
				1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home. In 1884
				Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton
				F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased
				the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which
				increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in
				1892. The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable. A further dispute between Houlding
				and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the
				company, "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd". Everton left Anfield for a new ground,<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park">Goodison Park</a>,
				where the club has played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and
				league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool
				F.C.

				Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892. Goodison
				Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only
				English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It was also the first English ground to
				have under-soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the
				Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.
